## Visual Identity

### Color Palette
The existing dark theme provides excellent differentiation from competitors who predominantly use light backgrounds. We will enhance this foundation with refined gradients and strategic accent colors.

**Primary Colors:**
- Background: Deep blue-gray (#111d22) - maintains brand identity
- Accent: Vibrant purple-blue (#5f6fff) - energetic, modern
- Text: Pure white (#ffffff) for maximum contrast
- Muted text: Light gray (#94a3b8) for secondary information

**Enhancement Colors:**
- Success green: #10b981 for positive actions
- Gradient overlay: Subtle purple-to-blue gradient for depth
- Card backgrounds: Slightly lighter (#1a2730) for layering

### Typography
Maintain existing font system with enhanced hierarchy and spacing for improved readability and visual impact.

**Hierarchy:**
- Hero headline: 4xl-6xl, bold, tight leading
- Section headlines: 3xl-4xl, semibold
- Feature titles: xl-2xl, medium
- Body text: base-lg, regular, relaxed leading
- Small text: sm, for disclaimers and captions
