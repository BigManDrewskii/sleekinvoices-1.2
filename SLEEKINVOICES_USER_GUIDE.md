## Creating & Sending Invoices

### Three Ways to Create Invoices

#### Option 1: Magic Invoice (AI-Powered) - Fastest

1. On the **Dashboard**, find the **Sleeky's Magic Invoice** section
2. Type a description in plain English, e.g., "Website design project for Q1, 40 hours at $75/hour"
3. Click **Generate Invoice**
4. Review the auto-populated invoice
5. Adjust line items, amounts, or due date as needed
6. Click **Save as Draft** or **Send Invoice**

**AI Features**: The AI understands natural language, calculates totals, and suggests appropriate line items based on your description.

#### Option 2: Smart Invoice Builder (Guided) - Recommended

1. Click **New Invoice** on the Dashboard
2. Select **Smart Invoice Builder**
3. Follow the 5-step flow:
   - **Step 1 - Client**: Select or create a client
   - **Step 2 - Services**: Add line items (description, quantity, rate)
   - **Step 3 - Amounts**: Review subtotal, adjust tax/discount if needed
   - **Step 4 - Due Date**: Choose due date (Due on Receipt, Net 15/30/60, or custom)
   - **Step 5 - Review**: Preview invoice and send or save as draft

#### Option 3: Classic Form (Full Control)

1. Click **New Invoice**
2. Select **Classic Form**
3. Fill in all fields:
   - **Client** (required)
   - **Invoice Number** (auto-generated, editable)
   - **Issue Date** (defaults to today)
   - **Due Date** (required)
   - **Line Items** (add multiple rows)
   - **Tax Rate** (percentage, optional)
   - **Discount** (percentage or fixed amount, optional)
   - **Notes** (optional, appears on invoice)
   - **Payment Terms** (optional, e.g., "Net 30")

4. Click **Save as Draft** to save without sending, or **Send Invoice** to email immediately

### Adding Line Items

Each invoice can have multiple line items:

1. Click **+ Add Line Item**
2. Enter:
   - **Description** (e.g., "Website Design Services")
   - **Quantity** (e.g., 10 hours)
   - **Rate** (e.g., $75/hour)
3. The total automatically calculates
4. Add more items by clicking **+ Add Line Item** again
5. Remove items by clicking the **trash icon**

**Pro Tip**: Use consistent descriptions and rates across invoices for easier tracking and analytics.

### Applying Tax & Discounts

**Tax**: Enter a percentage (e.g., 10% for VAT). The tax applies to the subtotal after discounts.

**Discount**: Enter either a percentage (e.g., 10% off) or a fixed amount (e.g., $50 off). Discounts apply before tax.

**Reverse Charge (EU VAT)**: If your client has a VAT number and is in the EU, the invoice automatically shows "Reverse Charge" instead of charging tax. This is compliant with EU VAT regulations.

### Saving vs. Sending

**Save as Draft**: The invoice is saved but not sent to the client. You can edit it anytime before sending. Drafts don't count toward your Free plan limit.

**Send Invoice**: The invoice is saved and immediately emailed to the client. This counts as 1 invoice toward your Free plan limit (if applicable). The client receives a professional email with the invoice PDF attached.

### Editing Invoices

1. Go to **Invoices** in the main menu
2. Find the invoice in the list
3. Click the **three-dot menu** → **Edit**
4. Make changes to any field
5. Click **Save Changes**

**Note**: You can only edit invoices in Draft status. Once sent, you can create a revised version or credit memo instead.

### Invoice Status Explained

**Draft**: Saved but not sent. You can edit freely and send anytime.

**Sent**: Invoice was emailed to the client. The client can view it and make payments.

**Viewed**: The client has opened the invoice (tracked via email or portal).

**Partially Paid**: The client has paid part of the invoice amount.

**Paid**: The full invoice amount has been received.

**Overdue**: The due date has passed and payment is still pending.

**Canceled**: The invoice was canceled and should not be paid.

## Best Practices

### Invoice Numbering

Use consistent, sequential invoice numbering for professional appearance and easy tracking. SleekInvoices auto-generates numbers, but you can customize the format:

- Simple: INV-001, INV-002, INV-003
- With Year: INV-2024-001, INV-2024-002
- With Client Code: INV-ACME-001, INV-ACME-002

**Pro Tip**: Never reuse invoice numbers. If you need to void an invoice, create a credit memo instead.

### Payment Terms

Clearly communicate payment expectations:

- **Due on Receipt**: Payment expected immediately (good for one-time projects)
- **Net 15**: Payment due within 15 days (standard for many businesses)
- **Net 30**: Payment due within 30 days (common for corporate clients)
- **Net 60**: Payment due within 60 days (for established clients)

Include payment terms on every invoice to avoid confusion.

### Tax Compliance

**Sales Tax**: If you're required to collect sales tax, add it as a line item or percentage on invoices.

**VAT (EU)**: If you're in the EU and your client is in another EU country with a valid VAT number, use the reverse charge mechanism. SleekInvoices handles this automatically.

**1099/Invoicing**: Keep detailed records of all invoices for tax filing. Export your data quarterly for accounting.

### Client Communication

**Professional Tone**: Use clear, professional language in invoice notes and email templates.

**Timely Invoicing**: Send invoices immediately after completing work to improve payment speed.

**Payment Reminders**: Enable automatic reminders 7-14 days after the due date to prompt payment without being aggressive.

**Follow-Up**: For invoices overdue by 30+ days, send a personal message to the client.

### Financial Management

**Monitor Cash Flow**: Check your **Outstanding Balance** on the Dashboard weekly to track receivables.

**Review Analytics**: Monthly, review the **Analytics** page to understand revenue trends and identify slow-paying clients.

**Categorize Expenses**: Properly categorize expenses for accurate profit/loss reporting and tax deductions.

**Reconcile Payments**: Regularly verify that payments recorded in SleekInvoices match your bank account.

### Security

## Troubleshooting

### Invoices Not Sending

**Problem**: Invoice email doesn't arrive in client's inbox.

**Solutions**:
1. Check the client's email address is correct (go to **Clients** and verify)
2. Ask the client to check spam/junk folder
3. Resend the invoice from the invoice details page
4. Verify your email domain is configured (go to **Settings** → **Email**)

### Payment Not Received

**Problem**: Client says they paid but invoice still shows unpaid.

**Solutions**:
1. Check your Stripe account for the payment (log into Stripe dashboard)
2. Manually record the payment in SleekInvoices (go to invoice → **Record Payment**)
3. For crypto payments, verify the transaction on the blockchain using the transaction hash
4. Contact support if payment appears in Stripe but not in SleekInvoices

### Crypto Payment Not Confirming

**Problem**: Client sent cryptocurrency but payment not confirmed.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify the transaction on the blockchain (Bitcoin, Ethereum explorer)
2. Check that the correct amount was sent (including network fees)
3. Ensure the payment was sent to the correct wallet address
4. Some networks take 10-30 minutes to confirm; wait longer
5. Contact support with the transaction hash for investigation

### QuickBooks Sync Issues

**Problem**: Invoice didn't sync to QuickBooks.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify QuickBooks is still connected (go to **Settings** → **Integrations**)
2. Check sync settings are enabled for that invoice type
3. Manually sync by clicking the **three-dot menu** → **Sync to QuickBooks**
4. Ensure the client exists in QuickBooks (sync clients first)
5. Disconnect and reconnect QuickBooks if issues persist

### AI Magic Invoice Not Working

**Problem**: Magic Invoice doesn't generate or generates incorrect results.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify you have AI credits remaining (check Dashboard)
2. Ensure your description is clear and specific (e.g., "10 hours of web design at $75/hour")
3. Try a simpler description if the AI seems confused
4. Use the Smart Invoice Builder as an alternative
5. Contact support if the issue persists

### Free Plan Invoice Limit

**Problem**: "Monthly invoice limit reached" error when creating invoice.

**Solutions**:
1. You've created 3 invoices this month on the Free plan
2. Upgrade to Pro for unlimited invoices ($12/month)
3. Wait until next month for your limit to reset
4. Delete draft invoices to free up space (only sent invoices count toward limit)

### Slow Performance

**Problem**: App is loading slowly or pages are sluggish.

**Solutions**:
1. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete on Windows, Cmd+Shift+Delete on Mac)
2. Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
3. Check your internet connection speed
4. Disable browser extensions that might interfere
5. Contact support if issues persist

### Lost Data

**Problem**: Invoice or client data is missing.

**Solutions**:
1. Check if you're logged into the correct account
2. Use the search function to find the data
3. Check if the data was deleted (deleted items can sometimes be recovered)
4. Contact support immediately with details about the missing data

### AI Features Questions

**Q: How does Magic Invoice work?**

A: Describe your invoice in plain English (e.g., "10 hours of web design at $75/hour"), and our AI parses the description, creates line items, and calculates totals automatically.

**Q: How many AI credits do I get?**

A: Free plan: 5 credits/month. Pro plan: 50 credits/month. Each invoice generation uses 1 credit. Purchase additional credits anytime.

A: No, Magic Invoice requires AI credits. Use the Smart Invoice Builder or Classic Form as alternatives (no credits required).

A: The AI is highly accurate for standard invoices. For complex scenarios, review the generated invoice before sending. You can always edit line items manually.

A: Yes. Your company logo, colors, and custom footer appear in the client portal, matching your invoice templates.

### Integration Questions
